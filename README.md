# BioBalance

## Overview

**BioBalance** (also known as **Aqua Smart**) is an eco-friendly aquarium system with real-time monitoring and adaptive controls. The project aims to create a smart aquarium that maintains optimal conditions for aquatic life through the integration of various sensors and automated systems.

## Project Roles

- **Software & Web Development**: Zach, Gautam, Ryan
- **CAD Design**: James
- **Hardware Development**: All team members
- **Scrum Master**: Zach

## Hardware Components

- **Raspberry Pi**: Central processing unit for the system.
- **Sensors**:
  - pH Sensor: Monitors the acidity/alkalinity of the water.
  - Temperature Sensor: Tracks the water temperature.
  - Nitrate Sensor: Measures nitrate levels in the water.
  - Salinity Sensor: Checks the salt concentration in the water.
  - Water Clarity Sensor: Assesses the clarity of the water.
- **Spectrum LED Lights**: Provides customizable lighting for the aquarium.
- **Motor & Servo**: Controls movement and operations within the aquarium.
- **Weight Scale**: Measures the weight of the aquarium components.
- **Water Pump**: Manages water flow within the aquarium.
- **Medium-Sized Fish Tank**: The main habitat for the aquatic life.
- **Waterproof Casing**: Protects electronic components from water damage.
- **UV Lights**: Sterilizes water to ensure a healthy environment.
- **Waterproof Camera**: Optionally used for computer vision and monitoring aquatic life.

## Software Components

- **Python**: Primary programming language used for system integration and sensor data processing.
- **Computer Vision**: (If using a camera) Analyzes the visual data from the aquarium for additional monitoring capabilities.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of water parameters (pH, temperature, nitrate, salinity, and clarity).
- Adaptive control of aquarium conditions through automated systems (lighting, water flow, etc.).
- Eco-friendly design ensuring a healthy and sustainable environment for aquatic life.
